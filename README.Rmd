<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->

# exclude

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of exclude is to keep track of excluded dataframe rows.

## Installation

You can install the development version of exclude like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("FRCBS/exclude")
```

## Examples

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r setup}
library(exclude)
library(tidyverse)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r Example 1}
## basic example code
mpg %>% 
  init_exclude() %>%
  filter(manufacturer == "audi") %>%
  exclude()
e <- get_exclude()
e
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

```{r}
as_tibble(e)
```

You can also plot the object with `plot(e)`, for example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(e)
```

<!--
Since plot calls DiagrammeR::grViz(), which returns htmlwidget, it cannot be included in an
md file directly. Below I use DiagrammeRsvg::export_svg() to convert htmlwidget to svg,
and then refer to the svg file from the md file. Other solution is to use the webshot2 package:
htmlwidgets::saveWidget(plot(e), "/tmp/x.html")
webshot2::webshot("/tmp/x.html", "/tmp/x.png")
And the refer to the png file from the md file.
-->

```{r plot1, echo=FALSE}
library(DiagrammeRsvg)
cat(export_svg(plot(e)), file = "man/figures/plot.svg")
```

```{r Example 2}
## basic example code
statistics <- function(df) { list(count = nrow(df), models=n_distinct(df$model)) }
mpg %>% 
  init_exclude(statistics = statistics) %>%
  filter(manufacturer == "audi") %>%
  exclude("Exclude non-Audi") %>%
  filter(cyl < 8) %>%
  exclude("Exclude 8-cylinder cars")
e2 <- get_exclude()
e2
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(e2)
```

```{r plot2, echo=FALSE}
cat(export_svg(plot(e2)), file = "man/figures/plot2.svg")
```
