# exclude

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of exclude is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of exclude like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("FRCBS/exclude")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(exclude)
library(tidyverse)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
## basic example code
mpg %>% 
  init_exclude("test") %>%
  filter(manufacturer == "audi") %>%
  exclude()
e <- get_exclude()
#as_tibble(e)
e
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
#plot(e)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
